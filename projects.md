I was the PI on a grant proposal for the Georgia Tech College of Science’s Sutherland Strategic Award. Our grant made history as the only undergraduate proposal to be funded and I became the founder and director of The Summer College Research Internship, an undergraduate-lead program that matches community college students from underrepresented backgrounds with full time summer research positions at Georgia Tech College of Sciences and assists in their academic and career development. Our fully undergraduate lead team successfully designed and executed program curriculum to ameliorate ‘pipeline leakage’ and promote belonging and inclusion for underserved students in science research. This program was funded for multiple years and continues to provide young community college students with their first research opportunities under the direction of successive undergraduate classes.
