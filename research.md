MRSA accounts for over 100,000 bloodstream infections annually worldwide and over 20,000 of these infections result in death. Clinicians rely solely on intravenous courses of the antibiotic vancomycin to clear these infections. With such widespread use and reliance, the chances of vancomycin resistance occurring in MRSA is likely an inevitability with catastrophic effects.

I first began working in 2021 as a research scientist at University of Pittsburgh to understand if multi-drug resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) could develop the necessary genetic mutations to defeat the only antibiotic effective against MRSA, vancomycin, making it potentially invincible. Weâ€™re currently in the process of successfully evolving vancomycin resistance in MRSA. Then, through careful study in the lab, we can use these evolved superbugs to quantify the level of threat that vancomycin resistance poses to vulnerable patients in the clinic.

My secondary project looks at potentiation, or the underlying harmless mutations that in the right context can drive important factors like antibiotic resistance. I study potentiation in relation to the drug-bug combination of Zerbaxa and Psuedomonas aeruginosa. Through machine learning modeling of in vitro evolution, we seek to predict those infections where resistance will arise. Partnering with UPMC, our research is the future of applying personalized medicine approaches to patients in the infectious disease space.
