I am currently a research scientist at the University of Pittsburgh. I have a B.S. in Biology from Georgia Institute of Technology and am a 2018 Stamps Presidentâ€™s Scholar.

At the University of Pittsburgh I study evolution as it pertains to antibiotic resistance. I am currently running 2 projects focusing on evolving de novo vancomycin resistance in MRSA, and using machine learning to predictively model resistance potentiation to the antibiotic Zerbaxa. I have a background in bioinformatics and infectious disease research, with earlier projects looking at computational gene discovery in breast cancer, patient-specific clinical modeling, and virulence in avian influenza.

I have a variety of other coding and programming projects which you can find on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/ShaniaKhatri). You can read more about any of my projects by following the links above, or by visiting the appropriate page from my homepage. If you'd like to get in touch with me, just send me an email at [shania.khatri@gmail.com](mailto:shania.khatri@gmail.com).
