I’m an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), certified to 2+ years, specializing in pre-hospital care, patient management, and ambulance operation. I work at Foxwall Emergency Medical Services in Pittsburgh, PA on the emergency and non-emergency transport line.

I spend a lot of time as a patient care volunteer at St. Margaret’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. I specialize in two departments, the Emergency Department and the outpatient ward of the Hillman Cancer Center. I restock supplies, sit with patients without a support person, and aid staff and patients in a variety of ways.

I am a docent at the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium. I’m a specially trained volunteer who gives educational talks, do guided tours, handle small animals, and run specialty zoo events.
